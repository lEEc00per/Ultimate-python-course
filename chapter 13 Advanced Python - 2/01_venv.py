# Every thing to do in this file of python is just by using terminal and the functions or the things which I had run in this file using the terminal are as follows:

# 1. Virtual Environment:
    # Type them in the terminal 
    # (a) pip install virtualenv [This installs the virtual environment on your device.]

    # (b) virtualenv MyProjectenvname [Any name of your choice]

    # (c) pip freeze > requirements .txt [‘pip freeze’ returns all the package installed in a given python environment along with the versions.]

    # (d) We can distribute this file to other users, and they can recreate the same environment using: pip install –r requirements.txt

# WHAT IS VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S USE?

# -> A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a specific Python interpreter and a set of libraries and dependencies for a Python project. It allows you to create an isolated environment for your project, separate from the global Python installation and other projects. This isolation ensures that dependencies for one project do not interfere with those of another.
